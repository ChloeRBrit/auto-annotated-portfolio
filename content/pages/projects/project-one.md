This is the game I'm currently working on which is a souls-like with Japanese theme but with a frog. It's main setting is in a pond where the main character the frog samurai lived before darkness came over the pond. While he was away he got a letter of this news so he travels back to see what he can do but realizes all of his friends have changed. Even his own father has changed which he has to fight him to release the last of the darkness from the pond. This is going to be a sad story with a sort of happy ending.



I have made the main character model, the map, the roofs etc. I show off the world and the models I have made. Of course as you can see this is a work in progress so if you have any tips or see something that can be improved upon email me! This is very much a passion project for me as I have always wanted to create a game. I have been a solo dev for this entire journey so far but if I had an opportunity to work with people I would. Being solo has it's advantages though, I have learned a lot in my time so far. I am going to learn even more as I continue my journey to develop this game.
