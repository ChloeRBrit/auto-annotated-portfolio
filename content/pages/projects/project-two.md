  The app I created goal is to be an inventory tracking system. This includes

  and a SMS system.

My inventory app starts at the log in or register screen.![](/images/LoginAndRegister.png) Once they user registers or types in their login they are able to go to the next screen which is enabling SMS or the welcome screen if they already been asked about notifications. ![](/images/studio64_EJYgzDvRiG.png)Once the client is fully logged into the app they are able to see the inventory. There is an update button at the bottom which takes them to the add or delete screen. ![](/images/studio64_C2GsKYV7cF.png)![](/images/updatepart.png)This allows them to type in the name of the item as well as the quantity. When they hit update they are taken back to the main inventory screen that they seen before but with the updated inventory. ![](/images/studio64_qSBsU6rmJs.png)
