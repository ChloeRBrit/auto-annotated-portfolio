  The app I created goal is to be an inventory tracking system. This includes
  adding and removing items from the grid inventory screen, a logging in system
  and a SMS system.

My inventory app starts at the log in or register screen. Once they user registers or types in their login they are able to go to the next screen which is enabling SMS or the welcome screen if they already been asked about notifications.
