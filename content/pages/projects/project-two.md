  The app I created goal is to be an inventory tracking system. This includes
  adding and removing items from the grid inventory screen, a logging in system
  and a SMS system. I used colors to make the user understand more about adding
  and removing. I used iterative development so every time I added a new system
  like login in I fully tested it then continued to add more systems which
  turned into the have I have. I tested it from the user side, as a whole and
  individually if able. I explained what the app was designed for at first, for
  people to able to track inventory. As I was coding, the adding system was a
  bit difficult but reading more about SQLite I was able to create a system that
  saves data from logins and the inventory.
